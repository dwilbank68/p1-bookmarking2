#BookmarkerX

by David Wilbanks

...is my first project from the [bloc.io](http://www.bloc.io) **Full Stack Web Development** course
(and it will get a decent name when I think of one).

A quick video demo will be available at [www.davidwilbanks.net](www.davidwilbanks.net) in early March 2015.

###The Requirements (altered slightly)

1. As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email.
1. As a user, I want to sign in and out of Blocmarks.
1. As a user, I want to email a URL to Blocmarks and have it saved in the Blocmarks database.
1. As a user, I want to see an index of all topics and their bookmarks.
1. As a user, I want to create/read/delete bookmarks.
1. As a user, I want to be the only one allowed to delete and update my bookmarks.
1. As a user, I want to "like and unlike" bookmarks created by other users.
1. As a user, I want to see a list of bookmarks on my personal profile that I've added or liked.

Yeah, it does all those things.
